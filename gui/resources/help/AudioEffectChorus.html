<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>The chorus effect simulates the richness of several nearly-identical
	sound sources (like the way a choir sounds different to a single singer).
	It does this by sampling from a delay line, so each voice is actually
	the same but at a slightly different point in time. This is a type of
	comb filtering.</p>
	<p>Chorus combines one or more samples ranging from the most recent
	sample back to about 50ms ago. The additional samples are evenly spread
	through the supplied delay line, and there is no modulation.</p>
	<p>If the number of voices is specified as 2, then the
	effect combines the current sample and the oldest sample (the last one
	in the delay line). If the number of voices is 3 then the effect combines
	the most recent sample, the oldest sample and the sample in the middle of
	the delay line.</p>
	<p>For two voices the effect can be represented as:<br/>
	result = (sample(0) + sample(dt))/2<br/>
	where sample(0) represents the current sample and sample(dt)
	is the sample in the delay line from dt milliseconds ago.</p>

	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>begin</span>(delayBuffer, length, n_chorus);</p>
	<p class=desc>Create a chorus by specifying the address of the delayline, the
	total number of samples in the delay line (often done as an integer multiple of
	AUDIO_BLOCK_SAMPLES) and the number of voices in the chorus <em>including</em>
	the original voice (so, 2 and up to get a chorus effect, although you can
	specify 1 if you want).
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>modify</span>(n_chorus);</p>
	<p class=desc>Alters the number of voices in a running chorus (previously started with begin).

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>The longer the length of the chorus, the more memory blocks are used.</p>
