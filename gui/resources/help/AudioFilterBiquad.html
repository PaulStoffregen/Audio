		Up to 4 stages may be cascaded.

	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>setLowpass</span>(stage, frequency, Q);</p>
	<p class=desc>Configure one stage of the filter (0 to 3) with low pass
		response, with the specified corner frequency and Q shape.  If Q is
		higher that 0.7071, be careful of filter gain (see below).
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>setHighpass</span>(stage, frequency, Q);</p>
	<p class=desc>Configure one stage of the filter (0 to 3) with high pass
		response, with the specified corner frequency and Q shape.  If Q is
		higher that 0.7071, be careful of filter gain (see below).
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>setBandpass</span>(stage, frequency, Q);</p>
	<p class=desc>Configure one stage of the filter (0 to 3) with band pass
		response.  The filter has unity gain at the specified frequency.  Q
		controls the width of frequencies allowed to pass.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>setNotch</span>(stage, frequency, Q);</p>
	<p class=desc>Configure one stage of the filter (0 to 3) with band reject (notch)
		response.  Q controls the width of rejected frequencies.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>setCoefficients</span>(stage, array[5]);</p>
	<p class=desc>Configure one stage of the filter (0 to 3) with an arbitrary
		filter response.  The array of coefficients is in order: B0, B1, B2, A1, A2.
		Each coefficient must be less than 2.0 and greater than -2.0.  The array
		should be type double.  Alternately, it may be type int, where 1.0 is
		represented with 1073741824 (2<sup>30</sup>).

	</p>
	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Filters can with gain must have their input signals attenuated, so the
		signal does not exceed 1.0.
	</p>
	<p>This object implements up to 4 cascaded stages.  Unconfigured stages will
		not pass any signal.
	</p>
	<p>Biquad filters with low corner frequency (under about 400 Hz) can run into
		trouble with limited numerical precision, causing the filter to perform
		poorly.  For very low corner frequency, the State Variable (Chamberlin)
		filter should be used.
