	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Record audio data by sending to the Arduino sketch.  This object allows
		sketch code to receive audio packets.</p>
	<h3>Audio Connections</h3>

	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>begin</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Begin capturing incoming audio to the queue.  After calling
		begin, readBuffer() and freeBuffer(), or clear() must be used frequently
		to prevent the queue from filling up.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>available</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Returns the number of audio packets available to read.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>readBuffer</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Read a single audio packet.  A pointer to a 128 sample
		array of 16 bit integers is returned.  NULL is returned if no packets
		are available.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>freeBuffer</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Release the memory from the previously read packet returned
		from readBuffer().  Only a single packet at a time may be read, and
		each packet must be freed with this function, to return the memory to
		the audio library.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>clear</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Discard all audio held in the queue.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>end</span>();</p>
	<p class=desc>Stop capturing incoming audio into the queue.  Data already
		captured remains in the queue and may be read with readBuffer().
	</p>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>
		Up to 52 packets may be queued by this object, which allows approximately
		150 ms of audio to be held in the queue, to allow time for the Arduino
		sketch to write data to media or do other high-latency tasks.

The actual packets are taken
		from the pool created by AudioMemory().
