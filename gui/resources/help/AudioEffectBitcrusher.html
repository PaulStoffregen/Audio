    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Reduce the samplerate and/or bitdepth of a source signal, resulting in
		a distorted sound.</p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p class=func><span class=keyword>bits</span>(xcrushBits);</p>
    <p class=desc>xcrushBits sets the bitdepth, from 1 to 16. A Value of 16
    does not crush the bitdepth, and is effectively a passthru for this part
    of the function.</p>

    <p class=func><span class=keyword>sampleRate</span>(xsampleRate);</p>

    <p class=desc>xsampleRate sets the frequency, from 1 to 44100Hz, however it
    works in integer steps so you will only really get a handful of results from
    the many samplerates you can pass. 44100 is passthru.</p>

    <p class=desc>set xbitDepth to 16 and xsampleRate to 44100 to pass audio
    	through without any Bitcrush effect.</p>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>Needs a lot of improvement. Options for anti-aliasing would be nice in
    the future, but for now, it's rough, it's dirty and it sounds a bit like
    Nine Inch Nails.

        should be used when changing
        settings on multiple objects, so all changes always take effect
        at the same moment.
