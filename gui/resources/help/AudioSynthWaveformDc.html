	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p>Create constant (DC) signal, useful for control of objects that take
		a modulation or control input signal.  This constant level can be
		used to modify other waveforms using mixer or multiplier objects</p>

	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>amplitude</span>(level);</p>
	<p class=desc>Set the output.  Level is -1.0 to 1.0.  The output is
		changed immediately.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>amplitude</span>(level, milliseconds);</p>
	<p class=desc>Set the output.  Level is -1.0 to 1.0.  The output is
		gradually changed over a "milliseconds" time period.  Any time may
		be specified, but periods longer than 1 second may be automatically
		shortened for small level changes, due to numerical precision limits.

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>Of course, the term "DC", for Direct Current, doesn't properly apply
		to a pure digital stream of numerical values.  But the term is widely
		understood in audio applications, so hopefully it's not too confusing?</p>
