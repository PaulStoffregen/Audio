	<h3>Functions</h3>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>frequency</span>(freq);</p>
	<p class=desc>Set the filter's corner frequency.  When a signal is
		connected to the control input, the filter will implement this
		frequency when the signal is zero.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>resonance</span>(Q);</p>
	<p class=desc>Set the filter's resonance.  Q ranges from 0.7 to 5.0.
		Resonance greater than 0.707 will amplify the signal near the
		corner frequency.  You must attenuate the signal before input
		to this filter, to prevent clipping.
	</p>
	<p class=func><span class=keyword>octaveControl</span>(octaves);</p>
	<p class=desc>Set how much (in octaves) the control signal can alter
		the filter's corner freqency.  Range is 0 to 7 octaves.  For
		example, when set to 2.5, a full scale positive signal (1.0) will
		shift the filter frequency up 2.5 octaves, and a full scale negative
		signal will shift it down 2.5 octaves.

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<p>
		When controlled by a signal, the equation for the filter
		frequency is:
	</p>
	<p>
		F = Fcenter * 2^<sup>(signal * octaves)</sup>

		help me improve this.....</small>
	</p>
	<p>When operating with signal control of corner frequency, this
		object uses approximately 4% of the CPU time on Teensy 3.1.
