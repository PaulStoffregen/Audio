 /**
  * Implementation of a double-buffer aimed at audio processing.
  * The aim is to have a minimal overhead while providing simple mechanisms
  * for signalling that (part of) the buffer needs re-filling, a source-agnostic
  * way of re-filling, content-agnostic readout, and built-in memory management.
  *
  * For playing from media, we need to:
  * * load large blocks from media to sequential memory in the buffer (single read() call)
  * * copy smaller data amounts from the buffer to temporary storage for de-interleaving
  * * flag when there is space to do a load from media
  *
  * For recording to media, we need to:
  * * save large blocks to media from sequential memory in the buffer (single write() call)
  * * copy smaller data amounts from temporary storage to the buffer
  * * flag when there is enough data to do a write to media
  *
  * This is very similar to a simple queue, except that we wish to deal in larger objects than
  * are usually used in queues, and the sizes used on input and output will typically be 
  * very different. For efficiency, we also want to be able to access the buffer directly
  * during medium read/write operations; for application use we need to use temporary storage,
  * because the different sizes will mean we're occasionally wrapping from buffer end back to
  * start, and we need a temporary buffer to (de)interleave audio blocks in any case.
  *
  * For example, a 16-bit stereo WAV file will require reading 512 bytes on every audio update;
  * an 8-channel file will take 2048 bytes.
  *
  * Typical playback buffer:
  * .....uuv|vvvvvvvv: . = unknown, u = used, v = valid
  * ^      ^  
  * |	   queueOut
  * queueIn
  *
  * .....uuu|uuvvvvvv: after next read()
  * nnnnnnnn|uuvvvvvv: after next readExecuted(): n = newly-read data
  * 		 ^ ^  
  * 		 | queueOut
  *    queueIn
  *  
  * Typical record buffer:
  * .....vvv|vvvvvv..: . = unknown, v = valid
  * 	 ^         ^  
  * 	 |         queueIn
  * 	 queueOut
  *
  * v....vvv|vvvvvvvv: after next write()
  * v....www|wwwwwwww: after next writeExecuted():  w = written
  * ^^  
  * |queueIn
  * queueOut
